# Gilded Rose Kata
This is my solution to the the [Gilded Rose kata](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/Gilded%20Rose.md). I used [this](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python) as my baseline.


I am using the kata to learn some basic design patterns.
